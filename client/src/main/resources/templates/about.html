                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Arbitrage Broker began its operations in the Netherlands in 2019, collaborating with many successful traders worldwide and leveraging various trading tools and resources. By 2020, we developed our first arbitrage bot, allowing us to achieve reliable, error-free profits in the cryptocurrency market. Currently, Arbitrage Broker operates approximately 100 bots to support and manage trades across the top 100 cryptocurrencies, providing successful, seamless gains for users globally, helping them trade confidently and without errors.</p>

                <h2>What is an Arbitrage Bot and Its Uses</h2>
                <p>An arbitrage bot is a sophisticated computer program or algorithm designed to conduct automated trading in cryptocurrency markets on behalf of traders or brokers. These bots are specifically programmed to profit from price differences of a particular asset across various exchanges. The primary goal of an arbitrage bot is to exploit price discrepancies across different exchanges, enabling traders to buy an asset at a lower price and almost immediately sell it at a higher price on another exchange. This automated process allows traders to earn consistent profits with minimal human intervention and reduced risk.</p>

                <h2>Arbitrage Concept</h2>
                <p>In cryptocurrency, arbitrage involves leveraging the price difference of an asset across different markets. This process focuses on buying at a lower price and simultaneously selling at a higher price to profit from the spread. Such opportunities arise due to market fluctuations and are quickly utilized by bots to ensure price alignment across markets and secure profits.</p>

                <h2>Key Features of Arbitrage Broker Bot</h2>

                <h2>Deposits</h2>
                <p>Currently, Arbitrage Broker operates on the TRC20 network for Tether (USDT) transactions and will soon support other networks as well. When making a deposit, users should double-check the broker's wallet address to avoid any potential loss of funds. <strong>Note:</strong> all deposits on the TRC20 network will be credited to user accounts after the transaction hash is verified, enabling users to start trading. If any issues arise, users should contact customer support. The capital amount deposited varies by plan and is locked for a period of 3 to 9 months, depending on the plan. After this period, users may withdraw their entire balance or start a new contract on the platform.</p>

                <h2>Withdrawals</h2>
                <p>Arbitrage Broker imposes no withdrawal limits. The minimum withdrawal amount is $15, allowing users to withdraw all profits earned from trading or from referrals. Withdrawals are processed to user accounts within 3 to 24 business hours after applicable fees are deducted.</p>

                <h2>Invite Friends</h2>
                <p>Arbitrage Broker offers an opportunity for users to share their invite codes with friends and family, earning income through successful referrals. For each successful referral that joins Arbitrage Broker, a reward of $1 to $20 is awarded to the primary user based on the referred person’s capital. The reward is credited automatically with the first deposit made by the referred user, and the primary user continues to receive rewards from each arbitrage the referral completes. <strong>Note:</strong> these rewards are provided by the platform itself, not from the referral’s earnings. Arbitrage Broker supports two levels of referrals. Users can earn rewards and participate in events and prizes held by the platform at the end of each period. For each referral at level A, 18% of the arbitrage profit is credited to the inviter’s account. For each referral at level B, 8% of the arbitrage profit is credited to the initial inviter's account.</p>
